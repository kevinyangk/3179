    <h3>Air crash history</h3>
    <p>To help establish a historical view of air crashes, we counted the number of air crashes from 1981 to 2022. 
        <br><br>Since the birth of the first aircraft in the world, plane has been mainly driven by propellers. During this period, the number of air accidents was less. However, with the development of science and technology, the emergence of new aircraft, and plane popularization in society, the number of air accidents increased year by year. Finally, with the heating up of World War II (1939-1945), the number of global air crashes peaked. 
        <br><br>After the end of World War II, the number of air crashes gradually decreased. With the large-scale use of jet aircraft, the overall relaxation of the global situation, the establishment of information management systems, and the advancement of security technology. The number of commercial airliner crashes has dropped significantly.</p>
    
    <h3>Deadly air crashes and casualties by country in history</h3>
    
        <p>From the perspective of the countries where air crashes occurred, the number of air crashes in the United States far exceeds that of other countries.</p>
    <h3>Aircraft accident model statistics</h3>
    
        <p>In terms of aircraft type, the number one air accident is the "Douglas DC-3 aircraft", followed by </p>
    <h3>Airline Accident Statistics</h3>
    
        <p>From the perspective of aircraft manufacturers, the number of air accidents ranked first is ( ), followed by ( ), and third is ( ).</p>
    <h3>Airplane Accident Cause Statistics</h3>  
    
        <p>It can be seen that the proportion of air crashes caused by pilot errors is nearly half, followed by mechanical failures and weather reasons.</p>  
    <h3>Accident statistics during flight</h3> 
    
        <p>A plane crashes phases are most common during takeoff and landing. The proportion of fatal accidents during takeoff and climb reached 42%, and the proportion during descent accounted for 35%. Due to the low flight altitude, the high risk of ground contact, the trim speed of the aircraft, and the large angle of attack, the risk of the crash are high at this stage.</p>
