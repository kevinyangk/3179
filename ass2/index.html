    <p>To help establish a historical view of air crashes, we counted the number of air crashes from 1981 to 2022. 
        <br><br>Since the birth of the first aircraft in the world, plane has been mainly driven by propellers. During this period, the number of air accidents was less. However, with the development of science and technology, the emergence of new aircraft, and plane popularization in society, the number of air accidents increased year by year. Finally, with the heating up of World War II (1939-1945), the number of global air crashes peaked. 
        <br><br>After the end of World War II, the number of air crashes gradually decreased. With the large-scale use of jet aircraft, the overall relaxation of the global situation, the establishment of information management systems, and the advancement of security technology. The number of commercial airliner crashes has dropped significantly.</p>

        <p>A plane crashes phases are most common during takeoff and landing. The proportion of fatal accidents during takeoff and climb reached 42%, and the proportion during descent accounted for 35%. Due to the low flight altitude, the high risk of ground contact, the trim speed of the aircraft, and the large angle of attack, the risk of the crash are high at this stage.</p>
